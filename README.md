# healthallround-crm
CRM for a health charity with a counselling service

Built to replace an existing Access database. Used to record client enquiries, manage bookings and attendance at activity groups and manage the organisation’s counselling service. The counselling section is only visible to staff counsellors and is used to manage appointments, client notes and mental health measurements.
